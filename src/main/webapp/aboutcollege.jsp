            <br>

            <p>The Kolkata district of West Bengal has always been regarded as a centre of academic excellence,
                priding itself on the distinct and unrivalled glory of the famous ancient colleges situated in
                this region. Government General Degree College, Singur, affiliated to the University of Burdwan
                has successfully and remarkably enhanced the glory of this area to a considerable extent within
                the first few years of its existence. The institute has gathered considerable respect in the
                academic arena as its students have often shown outstanding performance, with more than 50% of
                them securing First Class marks within the CBCS system under Calcutta University.</p>

            <p>Established in 2013 on more than 7 acres of land, situated in a luscious verdant and serene
                backdrop, the College is just a short distance away from Howrah Station on the Howrah-
                Tarakeswar Railway route, a mere 2 Kilometres away from Durgapur Expressway and only 35
                Kilometres away from Kolkata. Born out of the tireless efforts of the educationally attuned and
                culturally conscious civil society of Howrah and the goodwill of the Govt. of West Bengal, the
                institution is registering steady academic progress and adding to the everlasting glory of the
                region and its surroundings as well.</p>

            <p>Our teaching faculty comprises highly qualified, well-experienced and hardworking educators with
                a modern outlook who are ceaselessly working to shape the future of the students. The
                well-planned college building with its fairly well-stocked library, good laboratory facilities,
                computerized administrative milieu, amenities for sports and cultural activities, smart
                classrooms, ensure the holistic growth of the students. Regular assessments through tests and
                presentations help to enhance the competitive zeal of the students.</p>

            <p>The college welcomes students for three-year Honours courses in both Arts and Science streams
                with an array of 16 Honours subjects to choose from. The college offers subjects such as
                Anthropology and Psychology in the Science stream, providing aspiring learners the unique
                opportunity to study these two subjects at the undergraduate level – this is the only college
                under Burdwan University to do so. In the Arts stream, interested students may pursue the study
                of a globally recognized language such as English, or a classical Indian language such as
                Sanskrit, or a Modern Indian language like Bengali, or a Tribal language such as Santali,
                bespeaking the rich linguistic diversity of a nation like India. Apart from the honours courses
                regularly taught by the various departments, certain Value-added Courses are also scheduled from
                time to time to help widen the scope of education imparted to the students.&nbsp;<br>

                    Understanding (MOU)</strong> with the Honourable Vice-Chancellor of Rani Rashmoni Green
                University (RRGU). The University was partially set up at the premises the College building.</p>

            <p>Situated amidst lush greenness at Jalaghata, Singur, the aim of this college has always been to
                conserve the rich biodiversity within and around the college. The institute is always trying to
                minimize any interference during infrastructural development by focusing on sustainable
                co-existence.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In association with IQAC, GGDC Singur, the Career counselling sub-committee of the college
                organizes regular Career Counselling sessions since the year 2021, guiding the students to
                choose their future career path or course of higher studies after completion of the
                under-graduate degree.</p>

            <p>The Psychology department of the college has set up a <strong>psychological counselling cell for
                    students, faculty members and office staff of the college</strong>. There is a separate
                session room in the college where the department organises group sessions and individual
                sessions. &nbsp;</p>
